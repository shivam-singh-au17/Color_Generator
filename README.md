### Shravasti was a city of ancient and one of the six largest cities in India during Gautama Buddha's lifetime. The city is located in the fertile Gangetic plains some 170 km NE of Lucknow. Shravasti rose to fame due to its association with Buddha and Mahavira and became one of the eight holy places of Buddhist pilgrimage. Buddha is said to have spent 24 rainy seasons besides performing the Twin Miracle of emanating fire and water from his body here. Besides, Suhaildev Wildlife Sanctuary provides the perfect nature trail options to tourists and pilgrims alike.

# About The Project

### This is a personal project which I had to make on a theme so I decided to make it on the Shravasti district, Shravasti is a district of Uttar Pradesh that is known for the temples of Gautam Buddha and also known for its natural environment. I have completed my diploma from here for 3 years and I love this place so I have tried to make a small website on it so that people can know about it and my purpose for making this project is only my personal thinking and desire to improve my technical skills.

# Technologies I Used
